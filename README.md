# React-Calculator
Description: This app is class project in the Tech Talent South advanced code immersion class. We were tasked with using React to create one of 3 different applications. I chose the calculator app as an initial project on which to learn React. I used my own knowledge and a tutorial that I found to help me complete the project. 
Functionality: As of this moment, the app is not completely funcional. I have a had a challenge with the Screen component of the calculator. At first, I couldn't get the screen to appear. After I solved that problem, I haven't been able to get the screen to actually show the numbers from the buttons that are pushed. I will continue to work on this.
